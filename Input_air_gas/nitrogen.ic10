# The filtration unit should have input and output
# linked to a source of O2 (with standard
# temperature) and the filtered output connected to
# the room to fill.
# Adjust the PRESSURE_MIN and PRESSURE_MAX variable
# depending on the pressure of O2 you want in the
# room (other gases in the room will add to this
# pressure).
